// package `cfdb` is a database part/tracker for @geoffmcl's crossfeed.freeflightsim.org
//
// The intention of this package is to contain and record tracking data into postgis
// and record data in an efficient geospatical way for querying at a later stage..
// Kinda a replacment for fg-tracker, which record thousands of point as a log
// and no real geospatial content/context (imho pedro)
